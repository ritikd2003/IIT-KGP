## Overview

This repository contains the simulation codes developed during my **Summer Internship 2024** at **IIT Kharagpur**, under the guidance of **Dr. Vishwanath Shukla**. The focus was on exploring **2D turbulence** through spectral numerical methods using the **Dedalus** framework.

## Snapshot of My Journey

- **Random Walks in 1D & 2D**  
  Served as a warm-up to build foundational understanding of stochastic processes and their statistical behavior.

- **Main Focus – 2D Turbulence**  
  Carried out numerical simulations of:
  - Navier-Stokes equations (Newtonian turbulence)
  - Toner-Tu model (active turbulence)

- **Numerical Techniques Learned**
  - Spectral and pseudo-spectral methods
  - Use of Chebyshev polynomials
  - Time-stepping with Runge-Kutta methods
  - Visualization via HDF5-based snapshots

- **Dedalus Framework**  
  Gained hands-on experience with **Dedalus**, a powerful PDE solver that uses spectral methods and MPI-based parallelism for large-scale simulations.

This internship significantly enhanced my understanding of **numerical physics**, **scientific computing**, and **turbulence modeling**.
